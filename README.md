Repo for a basic web app that uses bs4 to scrape upcoming title boxing fights and displays them on a basic website
did this to learn webscraping, ended up incorporating Django for some backend stuff
Updates data once per month by checking the current day each time the web is loaded and if its matching the first of the month it rescrapes data for all users
